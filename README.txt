Developed by Ivan Luiz de Oliveira. Unesp Sorocaba, SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

This is a graduation project that uses a convolutional neural network for classifying a dataset of imagens taken in the UNESP Sorocaba automation lab.
The dataset is on the database folder and the respective classification are on the "classification_data.dat" file.
The codes are made on python 3 and are divided in: data acquisition for taking the pictures; Training the code where the CNN are created and trained; Operation that do the Integration of the CNN with the lab PLC via IOs.
A lot of the configurations in the algorithms are done via "config.cfg" file.
Hope this is going to be usefull for someone, some day.
